# RHOAS Provider

The RHOAS terraform provider includes resources to interact with Red Hat OpenShift Application Services, available as part of https://cloud.redhat.com/application-services

## Available Services 

[**OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka**](https://cloud.redhat.com/beta/application-services/streams/kafkas) is an cloud service for streaming data that reduces the operational cost and complexity of delivering real-time applications across hybrid-cloud environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    rhoas = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/redhat-developer/rhoas"
      version = "0.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "rhoas" {}

resource "rhoas_kafka" "foo" {
  name = "foo"
  plan = "developer.x1"
  billing_model = "standard"
}

output "bootstrap_server_foo" {
  value = rhoas_kafka.foo.bootstrap_server_host
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `offline_token` (String) The offline token is a refresh token with no expiry and can be used by non-interactive processes to provide an access token for Red Hat OpenShift Application Services. The offline token can be obtained from [https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token). As the offline token is a sensitive value that varies between environments it is best specified using the `OFFLINE_TOKEN` environment variable.
